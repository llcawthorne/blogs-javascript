# Pokemon API #

This is based on the blogpost "Understanding a RESTful API using Node.js, TypeScript and Pokemon" from:

<https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-a-restful-api-using-node-js-and-typescript-6f9cede6b579>

This turned out to be a less useful tutorial than I hoped (we don't even get into POSTing new Pokemon), but I liked the overall structure of what we're building, and I may come back to it and mess around with it more later.
