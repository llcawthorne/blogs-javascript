DZone had a four part (at least; not positive it's done) tutorial on Node.js, so
I made this as a place to follow along with it.  Here's the parts.

- Part 1: <https://dzone.com/articles/watch-a-writer-learn-nodejs-part-1>
- Part 2:
    <https://dzone.com/articles/nodejs-tutorial-for-beginners-part-2-working-with>
- Part 3:
    <https://dzone.com/articles/nodejs-tutorial-for-beginners-part-3-transferring>
- Part 4:
    <https://dzone.com/articles/nodejs-tutorial-for-beginners-part-4-making-an-app>

All the work for Part 2, 3, and 4 is in the express-app-ejs folder.  This is a
really simple app.  I'm not used to doing things with express though, so it was
still instructional to go through it.  I'm more accustomed to a Java backend.
